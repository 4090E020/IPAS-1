存取控制 access control (AC)
```

### 存取控制
```
In the fields of 【physical security(實體安全)】 and information security, 
access control (AC) is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource
while access management describes the process. 

The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.

Locks(鎖定) and login credentials(憑證) are two analogous mechanisms of access control
